# ->Our project uses Firebase Authentication to validate the users (students & counsellors)  on the basis of their valid college email ID.
# ->Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for our end users.
# ->Using Firebase allows us to avoid any fraudulent or fake sign-ins which could potentially lead to a unsatisfactory user experience and lead to exploitation of the platform. Firebase solves this problem.
 
### CURRENT SITUATION
# ->With the outbreak of covid-19 in the world schools, colleges and universities have shut down, some for more than a year which has led to student being on their own.
# ->A major cause of depression and stress among the students is the feeling of being being left out or being cut-off from the rest of the world, locked in their rooms. 
# ->This is often accompanied by the inability to express themselves to others or to share the problems they are facing.
## ->Community Feed

# ->Dedicated feed for users where they can share their daily experiences, each feed having a “like” button and feature to delete their post .
# ->When a student will update the feed by adding a new post, a push notification will be generated using Microsoft Azure.
## Memes
# ->Students can also share the meme they are interested in via any messaging platform and increase traction.
